# Random Dice App

Welcome to the Random Dice app, a simple iOS application developed as a part of Angela Yu's Udemy iOS 13 Development Course. This app is designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of iOS app development using Swift and the UIKit framework by creating a random dice roll simulator.

## App Description

The Random Dice app allows users to simulate rolling a dice by tapping a button. Upon tapping the button, the app generates a random dice face (number) and displays it on the screen. This project helps beginners learn about basic UI design, user interactions, and randomization in app development.

## Features

- Dice roll simulation: The app provides a button that, when tapped, generates a random dice face and displays it.
- Randomization: The app utilizes Swift's built-in random number generation functionality to achieve the random dice face generation.

## Development Environment

To run the Random Dice app on your local machine, you will need:

- Xcode: Make sure you have Xcode installed, as it's the primary development environment for iOS apps.
- Swift: The app is developed using the Swift programming language, so familiarity with Swift basics is helpful.
- UIKit: The app uses UIKit for building the user interface.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.
4. Tap the "Roll" button to simulate rolling a dice and see the random face.

## App Structure

The app's codebase is organized as follows:

- **Main.storyboard**: Contains the main user interface layout, including the roll button and the label for displaying the dice face.
- **ViewController.swift**: Handles the logic for generating random numbers and updating the user interface.
- **Assets.xcassets**: Contains the dice face images used in the app.
